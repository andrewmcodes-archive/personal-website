Hello! &#x1F44B; My name is Andrew Mason, and I am a full-stack developer specializing in Ruby on Rails. I am
passionate about open source and I also enjoy podcasting. When I am not at the keyboard, you will likely find me
surfing or digging into a good book. I am currently looking for my next role!

I am currently searching for my next team. I am a full stack developer with 2.5 year of professional experience with Ruby on Rails in small and medium sized companies. In that time, I have been responsible for architecting, developing, deploying, and evolving several applications and open source projects.
