**Andrew Mason**: Full Stack Ruby on Rails Developer

I am a full stack developer with 2.5 years of professional experience with Ruby on Rails in small and medium sized companies. I am very curious and love tackling new problems, which has has led to many open source contributions and collaborations with developers across the globe. My passion for community involvement has lead me to writing blog posts, becoming an active podcaster, and even trying my hand at live streaming.

**Fun fact:** I have gotten to interview DHH!

I am a self-motivated and largely self-taught professional who likes to dig deep into problems and architect elegant solutions.

When I am not at the keyboard, you will likely find me surfing or lounging on the beach with a good book.
